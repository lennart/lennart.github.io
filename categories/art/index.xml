      <title>Documentation: Tidal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having just recently learned about live coding in general, I got to know &lt;strong&gt;Tidal&lt;/strong&gt;, a domain specific pattern language for live coding written in &lt;strong&gt;Haskell&lt;/strong&gt;. Struggling with the hitherto state of the documentation being sprinkled across the mailing list, single &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; files on &lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt; and the wiki, I put up a &lt;em&gt;Github page&lt;/em&gt; and organized/themed the content that was already there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in contact with the developers of &lt;strong&gt;Tidal&lt;/strong&gt;, I tried grasp the concepts behind &lt;strong&gt;Tidal&lt;/strong&gt; to make the documentation both an easy start for beginners, a handy reference for users and a knowledge base for conceptually interested researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using only what github pages auto-build mechanism offers, I used twitter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; in the sass variant and &lt;strong&gt;jekyll&lt;/strong&gt; as the base for the page. I ordered the documentation into multiple chapters ranging from easy to complex and structured the list of available functions into logical groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added things like bootstrap&amp;rsquo;s scrollspy to help navigating a long list of menu entries and embedded syntax highlighting for the many code inlined snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation is kickstarted and released to the community to be continuously improved. Since I started working on it, others have contributed Howtos for &lt;strong&gt;MIDI&lt;/strong&gt; integration and just recently the editor Integration was updated to prefer the &lt;a href=&#34;http://atom.io&#34;&gt;Atom editor&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&#34;http://emacs.org&#34;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interactive exhibition guide for an art project in Braunschweig, Germany (my hometown) by students of the local university of arts. x artists turn private to public and exhibit their appartments. Each exhibition site is presented on a stylized map of Braunschweig and accompained by an audiosnippet giving a brief description of the works found there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, who helped building &lt;strong&gt;Brave New Work&lt;/strong&gt; as well and is also studying at HBK Braunschweig (university of arts) took part in the exhibition. I helped conceptualizing the website, webapp and implemented the core structure for both. While Aaron took care of the content and design, I was mainly working on the maps used in the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used knowledge from the former audiowalk and stripped it to the bare minimum. It is a responsive single-page app working with geolocation and some javascript for interaction. I used Tilemill to produce a distinct look for the map, which was used as a poster design for advertising the exhibition in Braunschweig.&lt;/p&gt;
