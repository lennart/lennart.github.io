      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a bicycle store in Berlin Friedrichshain, André decided to finally have his own website, apart from the facebook page he curates to keep in contact with his customers. We conceptualized the frontpage and structured content for the rest, to make it &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best website for a bicycle shop in Friedrichshain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to keep my work on implementing a whole website low, I decided to take care of communication with the programmer and André to mediate between the tech-side and the customer-side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I held a quick meeting with Michael who will implement the page via WordPress, and interviewed André to plan for the texts and pictures that are to be presented on his website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, everything is in rough shape and soonish to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
