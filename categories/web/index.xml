      <title>Documentation: Tidal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having just recently learned about live coding in general, I got to know Tidal, a domain specific pattern language for live coding written in Haskell. Struggling with the hitherto state of the documentation being sprinkled across the mailing list, single Markdown files on github and the wiki, I put up a Github page and organized/themed the content that was already there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in contact with the developers of Tidal, I tried grasp the concepts behind Tidal to make the documentation both an easy start for beginners, a handy reference for users and a knowledge base for conceptually interested researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using only what github pages auto-build mechanism offers, I used twitter&amp;rsquo;s bootstrap in the sass variant and jekyll as the base for the page. I ordered the documentation into multiple chapters ranging from easy to complex and structured the list of available functions into logical groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added things like bootstrap&amp;rsquo;s scrollspy to help navigating a long list of menu entries and embedded syntax highlighting for the many code inlined snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interactive exhibition guide for an art project in Braunschweig, Germany (my hometown) by students of the local university of arts. x artists turn private to public and exhibit their appartments. Each exhibition site is presented on a stylized map of Braunschweig and accompained by an audiosnippet giving a brief description of the works found there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, who helped building &lt;strong&gt;Brave New Work&lt;/strong&gt; as well and is also studying at HBK Braunschweig (university of arts) took part in the exhibition. I helped conceptualizing the website, webapp and implemented the core structure for both. While Aaron took care of the content and design, I was mainly working on the maps used in the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used knowledge from the former audiowalk and stripped it to the bare minimum. It is a responsive single-page app working with geolocation and some javascript for interaction. I used Tilemill to produce a distinct look for the map, which was used as a poster design for advertising the exhibition in Braunschweig.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The IT-Team of the vzbv, my current employer, relaunched the website for the project &amp;ldquo;Surfer haben Rechte — Verbraucherrechte in der digitalen Welt&amp;rdquo; (Surfers have rights — consumer rights in the digital world). I helped building the infrastructure, migrate content, teach editors and customize the template.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my holidays on crete, a friend of mine and I had some spare time left and rebuilt the website for an art-collective-backyard-something in Berlin Neukölln they run. It should be simple, both in its aesthetics and its caring for. I called a friend of mine at work in germany to setup FTP and the domain and we went online before returning to germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main goal was for Angelina to be able to add/edit events, pictures and content on her own. I decided to not use any content management system for it and helped her learn just a bit of markdown and handling ftp to publish a new version of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used wintersmith, a static site generator based on node.js which makes it easy to organize your content and also blazing fast in delivery, since it&amp;rsquo;s all static HTML/CSS in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a internal web application for a small group of people reviewing educational publications by a strict reviewing schema.
Reviews eventually get published on a website to aid teachers in selection educational material for their classes. Publication&amp;rsquo;s metadata is added by moderators and assigned to reviewers, quality controlled and then published via an external interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application was built based on Symfony 2 and features a complete workflow engine and a complex 8 tabbed form that tries to avoid usual the pains of editing lengthy, complex forms by visual hints of completeness rather than displaying the notorious error messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export is done via exposing a JSON REST interface of the published reviews, which get picked up by a separate website that consumes reviews and displays them on a website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a shopping portal for art prints on-demand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a team of about 5 people we created a platform for photographers, illustrators, designers and even hobbyists to share and sell their art online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform also sported curated collections and additionally hosted vast libraries of different partners namingly national geographic, lonely planet images and bridgeman. Customers could buy their favourite images printed on varying media like poster, canvas or aluminium dibond which was manufactured on demand, first in germany then in north america as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was involved in conceptualizing the architecture, programming the print-product configurator, implementing the order-system and payment, building the activity feed and profile pages for the community, helped on templating, hosting and optimizing the caching system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main task behind the scenes however was eventually producing a toolchain for importing image libraries from all the partners we acquired and sanitizing and mapping metadata to the platform, including pregenerating thumbnails for the various listings and types of image display of a single product. The toolchain could be used without programming knowledge, but it sported a code editor that would allow running snippets of mapping code across a whole set of metadata for a certain partner that was stored before being imported into the main web-application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the company after it successfully maintained a constant revenue in early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
