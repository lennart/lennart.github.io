            <p>Being a bicycle store in Berlin Friedrichshain, André decided to finally have his own website, apart from the facebook page he curates to keep in contact with his customers. We conceptualized the frontpage and structured content for the rest, to make it <em>the</em> best website for a bicycle shop in Friedrichshain.</p>

The platform also sported curated collections and additionally hosted vast libraries of different partners namingly national geographic, lonely planet images and bridgeman. Customers could buy their favourite images printed on varying media like poster, canvas or aluminium dibond which was manufactured on demand, first in germany then in north america as well.

My attempts to fix the radio itself failed miserably, so I tried to built an not reliably working mp3 player (with a working fm-radio) into the case an hook up a simple amplifier to it.</p>

We took a look at what kinds of other communities were around and found a project called &ldquo;clevershit&rdquo;, which was a simple forum that had been setup by one of the students of computer science to gather all these information, and for others to exchange their thoughts. We strived to solve a problem, that was already solved.</p>

That was about how far we got.</p>
