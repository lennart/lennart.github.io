      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day, the old portable radio stopped working. I really liked it and promised to make bring it back to life. Cracked open I realized, I am not an electronics expert, and by far not a radio expert. My attempts to fix the radio itself failed miserably, so I tried to built an not reliably working mp3 player (with a working fm-radio) into the case an hook up a simple amplifier to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This failed as well, as you can see, these are the parts and each of them worked on its own. The amplifier, the speaker, the on/off/volume knob and so on. But putting it all together, it didn&amp;rsquo;t and that&amp;rsquo;s the state it is in now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered some replacement parts online, an fm module, an amplifier module etc. Maybe one day it will be a working radio again.&lt;/p&gt;
