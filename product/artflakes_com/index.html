    <p><em>a shopping portal for art prints on-demand.</em></p>

<p>In a team of about 5 people we created a platform for photographers, illustrators, designers and even hobbyists to share and sell their art online.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The platform also sported curated collections and additionally hosted vast libraries of different partners namingly national geographic, lonely planet images and bridgeman. Customers could buy their favourite images printed on varying media like poster, canvas or aluminium dibond which was manufactured on demand, first in germany then in north america as well.</p>

<p>I was involved in conceptualizing the architecture, programming the print-product configurator, implementing the order-system and payment, building the activity feed and profile pages for the community, helped on templating, hosting and optimizing the caching system.</p>

<p>My main task behind the scenes however was eventually producing a toolchain for importing image libraries from all the partners we acquired and sanitizing and mapping metadata to the platform, including pregenerating thumbnails for the various listings and types of image display of a single product. The toolchain could be used without programming knowledge, but it sported a code editor that would allow running snippets of mapping code across a whole set of metadata for a certain partner that was stored before being imported into the main web-application.</p>

<p>I left the company after it successfully maintained a constant revenue in early 2012.</p>
