  What you are seeing is the main entry point from which each individual piece of my works can be reached.

  Most of these projects are collaborative efforts. The whole is divided into rough chapters that map to periods of my life in the
  <del>computing</del> world, others might say this is a curriculum vitae, I would rather call it a living document

              <h2>Bewertungs Raster Anwendung</h2>

              
 <p>a internal web application for a small group of people reviewing educational publications by a strict reviewing schema.
Reviews eventually get published on a website to aid teachers in selection educational material for their classes. Publication&rsquo;s metadata is added by moderators and assigned to reviewers, quality controlled and then published via an external interface.</p>

<p>The application was built based on Symfony 2 and features a complete workflow engine and a complex 8 tabbed form that tries to avoid usual the pains of editing lengthy, complex forms by visual hints of completeness rather than displaying the notorious error messages.</p>

<p>Export is done via exposing a JSON REST interface of the published reviews, which get picked up by a separate website that consumes reviews and displays them on a website.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Lennart Melzer. That's L-E-N-N-A-R-T, the nordic version. My last name—Melzer (from the word malt, as used in e.g. beer)—originates from the craft of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing" target="_blank">brewing</a>. I do lots of sorts of things, some of which you could read above, others which I don't tell and even others still to come. If you want to contact me, for <em>any</em> reason, please do so through plain email via my first name at my last name dot the italian suffix for domains. (Since emails tend to be spammed, I am not writing my <em>real</em> email address here. So if my first name would be <em>For</em>, my lastname <em>Example</em> and I'd be having a commercial suffix in my domain, it would be <strong>for@example.com</strong>, but it isn't).</p>
