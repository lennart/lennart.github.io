    <h2>clevershit</h2>

    

    <p>Back in university a friend of mine and I were fed up with the way we had to <em>manage</em> aggregating all the documents, papers and all the stuff we got in university, to read and process. We took a look at what kinds of other communities were around and found a project called &ldquo;clevershit&rdquo;, which was a simple forum that had been setup by one of the students of computer science to gather all these information, and for others to exchange their thoughts. We strived to solve a problem, that was already solved.</p>

<p>Driven by our half-god complex, of doing it better, doing it <em>the right way</em>, we tried to build a platform based on the—back then hip and trendy—web application framework Ruby on Rails. An utterly over-engineered piece of software to build an utterly over-engineered platform.</p>

<p>We wanted to create a simple to use, highly flexible way of sharing and collaborating on <em>content</em> and never came to a close. All our prototypes never came across that stage, being a prototype. Essentially, what was missing, was the contact to other people, that would want to use it. We just tried to build a platform for a pretty narrow community, namely: us two. That is, we never bothered to ask what others might need, where the real pain points with the current solutions were.</p>

<p>All the other students were happy that &ldquo;clevershit&rdquo;, a forum, existed and, at least I had to learn that sometimes, worse is better.</p>
