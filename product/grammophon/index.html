<p>nifty frontend for <del>upcoming</del> distributed, decentralized music management.
I tried hard, but it stayed a prototype, until it became abandoned.</p>

<h2 id="idea:4650e17b77f8eb081291cfaa4085d5c7">idea</h2>

<p>At first I tried to reinvent something that was already there: <a href="http://github.com/RJ/playdar-core"><strong>playdar</strong></a><br />
Try to grasp the idea behind <strong>playdar</strong> first, being able to enter any artist/track combination and let playdar to the heavy lifting, in this case <em>get the nearest location from where you can play that song</em>. Now combine this with your average music consumption and you might realize that there&rsquo;s still a need for management. Something that <strong>playdar</strong> itself doesn&rsquo;t and <em>by design</em> will not offer.</p>

<p>People use <strong>iTunes™</strong> for a reason, not because they love apple so much, but because it takes the load of music (and sadly recently media) management off your back. It&rsquo;s elegant and easy to use.</p>

<p>So you might ask:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>what&rsquo;s wrong with using iTunes?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the <em>original idea</em> behind <strong>iTunes</strong>, it&rsquo;s the current state of the <em>implementation</em>. The concept of <strong>UNIX&rsquo;s</strong> command line applications applied to GUI-based apps, &ldquo;let <strong>one</strong> application do <strong>one</strong> thing only and therefore do it <strong>extraordinary well</strong>&rdquo;, has seen it&rsquo;s manifestation in the <strong>OPENStep</strong> draft and current implementation in Apple&rsquo;s <strong>Mac OS X</strong>. Your operating system should have <strong>one</strong> application to manage your contacts, <strong>one</strong> for managing your calendar, <strong>one</strong> for looking up words, <strong>one</strong> for viewing documents&hellip; the list goes on. I appreciate Apple&rsquo;s way of doing that and therefore I am using it, despite the fact that I don&rsquo;t like this company <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>They <em>did</em> a good job, but now we&rsquo;re in the age of cloud-computing, constant internet connection and so on. Times have changed and what once was a simple <em>music player</em> called iTunes, is now merely a host for random upcoming store shelves for the Apple company, selling and trying to manage everything not limited to music anymore.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>iTunes</strong> has become the most bloated piece of software, avenged to the league of horrible things like <strong>eclipse</strong> or the <strong>ICQ</strong>-client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They failed at the heart of their current operating system, letting their former <strong>music player</strong> become an operating system itself, throwing away the aforementioned concept of &ldquo;do <strong>one</strong> thing and do it well&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One should take into account that Apple is still a company and they deploy iTunes to <strong>Mac OS X</strong> as well as Windows, so there is little reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t put their main selling product (the iTunes-Store frontend) into their most used desktop application.<br />
Fair enough, but I <em>want</em> that simplicity, I <em>want</em> that &ldquo;do <strong>one</strong> thing and do it well&rdquo; concept, especially for my music, but also for movies and maybe even music videos. I <em>want</em> separate applications for that and I want each of them to network. That&rsquo;s the main argument why I don&rsquo;t want to use iTunes anymore.<br />
Apple&rsquo;s implementation of the DAAP-Protocol in iTunes is a joke. I don&rsquo;t want to log into my iTunes-Store account to hear streamed music from the computer standing next to me.<br />
Let&rsquo;s repeat, &ldquo;<strong>playdar</strong> let&rsquo;s me hear the songs I want, from the nearest location that has it available&rdquo;, so to put it with <a href="http://github.com/jchris">jchris&rsquo;</a> words <a href="http://jchrisa.net/drl/_design/sofa/_show/post/Imagine-There-s-No-YouTube">&ldquo;This is not a technology problem, it&rsquo;s a problem of imagination.&rdquo;</a>.<br />
<a href="http://playlick.com"><strong>playlick</strong></a> is the first part of the puzzle, but for me, it lacks a lot of stuff, mainly it lacks the desktop-application-feeling.<br />
This project is an attempt to build exactly that, a &ldquo;desktop-like&rdquo; application serving just one purpose <em>managing the music you listen to, regardless of where it is physically located</em>. Think of it as the <a href="http://grooveshark.com/"><strong>grooveshark</strong></a> but without the necessary coupling to the cloud. If there&rsquo;s a song on your harddrive, then you can play it. If it is just available on youtube, then you can play it. I really like grooveshark, but the fact, that their database is far away from complete and predictably will always be, renders it useless to me.</p>

<h2 id="implementation:4650e17b77f8eb081291cfaa4085d5c7">Implementation</h2>

<p>At first I wanted it to be a Cocoa application, hence Mac OS X only.<br />
Great, nothing wrong with that, Cocoa offers a great potential for building efficient and elegant applications, but it&rsquo;s limited to one platform and still, Apple&rsquo;s mashup-capabilities for Software development are kind of&hellip;non-existant.<br />
So currently this project is using Adobe&rsquo;s Flash runtime, specifically the Flex 4 SDK and the <a href="http://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework">robotlegs-framework</a>, but one should consider this a <em>proof-of-concept</em>, an idea put into bits. In the future there may be native applications for each platform, but for now Flash serves well being available on all major platforms.<br />
I started implementing <a href="http://github.com/lennart/playdar-core/tree/crossdomain">dynamic crossdomain.xml generation into playdar-core</a> to allow flex applications to interface with your local playdar daemon. I use imlucas&rsquo; as3playdar to interface with playdar and started to integrate blip.fm read-only support (which is one of the sources I wanted to have access to). At the current stage, simple search, blip.fm feed-loading, resolving, playlist building and playing works. That said, there is apparently nothing of the mentioned <em>managing</em> capabilites integrated.</p>

<h2 id="usage:4650e17b77f8eb081291cfaa4085d5c7">Usage</h2>

<p>I try to keep a working up2date version hosted on the corresponding github-page for this project. You currently need a crossdomain-enabled built of playdar installed on you local computer and there are no prebuilt installers yet. One could pretty much say, this is still a developers project and not usable for anyone else. However, as soon as the crossdomain support is merged into playdar, using it should be as simple as clicking on the &ldquo;Playdar.prefpane&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;Windar Installer&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<h2 id="the-future:4650e17b77f8eb081291cfaa4085d5c7">The Future™</h2>

<p>I cannot resist to use <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">couchdb</a> as the database for the music metadata, sadly there is currently no native erlang implementation of <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">lucene</a> or any other search-indexer.</p>
