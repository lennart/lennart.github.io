  Most of these projects are collaborative efforts. The whole is divided into rough chapters that map to periods of my life in the

              <h2>Minority WiiPort</h2>

              
 <p>Tracking hand gestures from a WiiMote mounted above a projection surface, letting you pinch &amp; zoom images on the big screen from the tip of your fingers. I wrote the 3D rendering code using the <strong>OGRE</strong> Game engine.</p>

<p>Interestingly most of the concepts we introduced here for gesture recognition, tracking of motion, and interaction with media, was later implemented in other software, most prominently the <em>pinch and zoom</em> on the iPhone, which has been a key feature—though rather clumsy—within our own simple experiment.</p>

<p>Apart from the actual coding of the software—which is pure <code>C++</code> using some additions from the <em>Technical Report 1</em> like smart pointers—this project was highly collaborative in version control via <strong>svn</strong> and a complex build system using <strong>scons</strong>. Our team consisting of six people had to coordinate our progress within the source code and build system while maintaining a working prototype.</p>

<p>Components of the project were: <strong>WiiMote</strong> interfacing, gesture recognition using <em>Markov chains</em>, logic dispatching, rendering and documentation.</p>

<p>Interestingly we did not completely agree on a License making it possible to distribute the code for <em>commercial</em> use. Some of our colleagues were strong defenders of the <strong>GNU</strong> ideology referring to <em>free</em> as in free speech, not as in beer.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Lennart Melzer. That's L-E-N-N-A-R-T, the nordic version. My last name—Melzer (from the word malt, as used in e.g. beer)—originates from the craft of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing" target="_blank">brewing</a>. I do lots of sorts of things, some of which you could read above, others which I don't tell and even others still to come. If you want to contact me, for <em>any</em> reason, please do so through plain email via my first name at my last name dot the italian suffix for domains. (Since emails tend to be spammed, I am not writing my <em>real</em> email address here. So if my first name would be <em>For</em>, my lastname <em>Example</em> and I'd be having a commercial suffix in my domain, it would be <strong>for@example.com</strong>, but it isn't).</p>
