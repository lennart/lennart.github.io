  Most of these projects are collaborative efforts. The whole is divided into rough chapters that map to periods of my life in the

              <h2>Rue Bunte</h2>

              
 <p>During my holidays on crete, a friend of mine and I had some spare time left and rebuilt the website for an art-collective-backyard-something in Berlin Neukölln they run. It should be simple, both in its aesthetics and its caring for. I called a friend of mine at work in germany to setup FTP and the domain and we went online before returning to germany.</p>

<p>My main goal was for Angelina to be able to add/edit events, pictures and content on her own. I decided to not use any content management system for it and helped her learn just a bit of markdown and handling ftp to publish a new version of the website.</p>

<p>We used wintersmith, a static site generator based on node.js which makes it easy to organize your content and also blazing fast in delivery, since it&rsquo;s all static HTML/CSS in the end.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Lennart Melzer. That's L-E-N-N-A-R-T, the nordic version. My last name—Melzer (from the word malt, as used in e.g. beer)—originates from the craft of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing" target="_blank">brewing</a>. I do lots of sorts of things, some of which you could read above, others which I don't tell and even others still to come. If you want to contact me, for <em>any</em> reason, please do so through plain email via my first name at my last name dot the italian suffix for domains. (Since emails tend to be spammed, I am not writing my <em>real</em> email address here. So if my first name would be <em>For</em>, my lastname <em>Example</em> and I'd be having a commercial suffix in my domain, it would be <strong>for@example.com</strong>, but it isn't).</p>
