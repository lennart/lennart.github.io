    <h2>the radio</h2>

    

    <p>One day, the old portable radio stopped working. I really liked it and promised to make bring it back to life. Cracked open I realized, I am not an electronics expert, and by far not a radio expert. My attempts to fix the radio itself failed miserably, so I tried to built an not reliably working mp3 player (with a working fm-radio) into the case an hook up a simple amplifier to it.</p>

<p>This failed as well, as you can see, these are the parts and each of them worked on its own. The amplifier, the speaker, the on/off/volume knob and so on. But putting it all together, it didn&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s the state it is in now.</p>

<p>I ordered some replacement parts online, an fm module, an amplifier module etc. Maybe one day it will be a working radio again.</p>
