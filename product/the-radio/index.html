              <h2>the radio</h2>

              
 <p>One day, the old portable radio stopped working. I really liked it and promised to make bring it back to life. Cracked open I realized, I am not an electronics expert, and by far not a radio expert. My attempts to fix the radio itself failed miserably, so I tried to built an not reliably working mp3 player (with a working fm-radio) into the case an hook up a simple amplifier to it.</p>

<p>This failed as well, as you can see, these are the parts and each of them worked on its own. The amplifier, the speaker, the on/off/volume knob and so on. But putting it all together, it didn&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s the state it is in now.</p>

<p>I ordered some replacement parts online, an fm module, an amplifier module etc. Maybe one day it will be a working radio again.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Lennart Melzer. That's L-E-N-N-A-R-T, the nordic version. My last name—Melzer (from the word malt, as used in e.g. beer)—originates from the craft of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing" target="_blank">brewing</a>. I do lots of sorts of things, some of which you could read above, others which I don't tell and even others still to come. If you want to contact me, for <em>any</em> reason, please do so through plain email via my first name at my last name dot the italian suffix for domains. (Since emails tend to be spammed, I am not writing my <em>real</em> email address here. So if my first name would be <em>For</em>, my lastname <em>Example</em> and I'd be having a commercial suffix in my domain, it would be <strong>for@example.com</strong>, but it isn't).</p>
